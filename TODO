In other distributions:
- $version::LAX (via [RewriteVersion]'s provide_version) does not recognize us
    but should it? it is defined as:
        ...a positive decimal number (integer or
        decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
        v-string. If the v-string has fewer than three components, it must
        have a leading 'v' character. Otherwise, the leading 'v' is optional.
        Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing "alpha"
        component separated by an underscore character after a fractional or
        dotted-decimal component.
