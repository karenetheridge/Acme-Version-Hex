=head1 NAME

Acme::Version::Hex - a module that declares its $VERSION in hexadecimal

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0009765625

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Version::Hex;

    my $version = Acme::Version::Hex->VERSION;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module demonstrates the use of a floating point hexadecimal number in its
C<$VERSION>.

Support for hexadecimal floating point literals (like C<0x1.23p-4>) was added
in L<perl5213delta|perl 5 version 21.3>. This distribution is a test of the
toolchain's ability to deal with this version, either in recent perl versions
or earlier.
